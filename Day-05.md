# 102 - Day 05

## What I learned today

### Design web pages with CSS

Helpful tips
- For the body/overall width of your page, use at least a 960 (previous standard) or 1024 is also good because it is easily divisible between other resolution
- `margin: auto` centers the content within the container
- `text-align: center` centers text
- `max-width: 960px;` is also good to add
- for lists and nav bars
    - `list-style-type: none`
    - `display: inline`
- use `border-radius: 100px` on borders and images to make them circular
- `clear: both` after `float: left | right`
- make sure to choose the correct selector `<a>` when removing underline properties from links
    - `text-decoration: none`
- HERO image    
    - all images start off as inline elements. Make sure you set your HERO pictures as a `display:block` so that it has it's own line
    - `margin: auto` to center within the body
- `&copy;` adds a copyright symbol
- You can create a list of images by putting an `<a href>` link inside a `li` tag

### Reflection
  
The studying before hand really did pay off. I felt confident on the topic of HTML and CSS. The the final product of my lab-05 project came out beautiful I was impressed. Drawing a wireframe is key to building a good website. I figured out that, it's easier to build out the website by tackling one part at a time.  
Example
1. Header
    - Banner
    - Nav bar
2. Main
    - Hero
3. Footer
    - &copy;
