# 102 - Day 06

## What I learned today



### Comparison and logical operators


### for and while loops
- For: if you need to run a specific number of times, use a for-loop (this is the most common loop).
  - utilizes a counter to tell how many times the loop should run
- While: use a while loop if you do not know how many times the code should run.
  - the condition here can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.
- Do While: same as the while loop, will ALWAYS run what is inside the curly braces at least once

### for loop
- the for loop _condition_ is made up of 3 statements: `for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  1. initialization: acts as a counter `var i = 0`
  2. condition: the loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specific number `i < 10`
  3. update: every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter `i++
