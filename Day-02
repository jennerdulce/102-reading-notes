## 102 - Day 02

### What I learned today

- A computer is like a bicycle for the mind. We use it to make greater strides while spending less energy.
- Graphical User Interface **(GUI)** is how you normally navigate folders to open files and documents
- Terminal is a **non-GUI**
  - Similar in its uses to a GUI
  - Text only based version
  - Can find, add, delete, and create folder
- Some basic terminal commands that **will not** blow up your computer:
  - **_pwd_** (print working directory): displays which directory you are currently in
  - **_whoami_**: displays which user is currently logged in
  - **_ls_** (lists): lists the contents of the directory you are in
  - **_cd_** (change directory): changes directory
    `cd folder_name`
  - **_cd.._**: go back one
  - **_cat_**: prints everything in the file/document you select
    `cat file_name.txt`
  - **_cd~_**: returns to home
  - **_mkdir_** (make directory): creates a folder
    `mkdir folder_name`
  - **_touch_**: creates a file
    `touch file_name.txt`
  - **_rm_** (remove file): removes files
    `rm file_name`
  - **_rm -r_** (recursive): removes folder
- **IDEs** (Integrate Development Environments) are beneficial and make coding easier!
  - colorization and syntax highlighting: color coordinates specific parts so that code is easier to read
  - error indicator/shows descrepancies
  - customizable
**Don't Get Frustrated :)**
