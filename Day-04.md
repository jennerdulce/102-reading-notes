## What I learned today

### HTML
- `<p>` is a tag
- `<p>This is a whole element, it includes a tag and text</p>`
- 2 types of tags:
    - block: takes up the entire eidth of the container that it is housed in
        - Typically structural usage
    - inline: only takes up the space of the content itself
        - Used for content
- Semantic tags/structure help with SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
    - Helps locate within google search
    - Enables other developers to easily identify parts of the HTML 
- `<head>`
    - meta data
    - dependencies (Java/CSS) `<link>`
- `<body>` is where the content is shown
- http://placehold.it/dimensionxdimension/
- `&copy;` creates a copyright

### Website tips
